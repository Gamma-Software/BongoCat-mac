## What is BongoCat?

BongoCat is a popular internet meme featuring a cat playing bongos, originally created by [DitzyFlama](https://twitter.com/DitzyFlama) using [StrayRogue's](https://twitter.com/StrayRogue) adorable cat drawing. This project brings the interactive BongoCat experience to macOS as a native application.

## 🚀 Installation

### 📋 Requirements
- **macOS 13.0 (Ventura)** or later
- **Accessibility permissions** for global input monitoring
- **~5MB disk space** for the application

### 📥 Download Options

#### **🎯 Ready-to-Use (Recommended)**
1. Download the latest `BongoCat-*.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/Gamma-Software/BongoCat-mac/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag BongoCat to Applications
3. **Right-click** on BongoCat in Applications and select **"Open"** (see [Gatekeeper Guide](GATEKEEPER_GUIDE.md))
4. Grant accessibility permissions when prompted

**💡 Pro Tip**: If you're reinstalling and accessibility permissions keep being asked, use the packaged DMG instead of building from source. The official releases are code signed for consistent identity.

**🔐 Security Note**: On first launch, macOS may show a security warning. This is normal for apps not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. See our [Gatekeeper Guide](GATEKEEPER_GUIDE.md) for safe launch instructions.

#### **🛠️ Build from Source**
Perfect for developers or those who want the latest features:

### Building from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gamma-Software/BongoCat-mac.git
cd BongoCat-mac

# Quick build and test
./Scripts/build.sh
swift run

# Or build manually
swift build
swift run
```

### Development Scripts
The project includes helpful scripts in the `Scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Build the project
./Scripts/build.sh

# Bump version (updates all version references)
./Scripts/bump_version.sh 1.0.2

# Create distributable DMG
./Scripts/package_app.sh

# Package for App Store distribution
./Scripts/package_app.sh --app_store

# Clear accessibility permissions (if having issues)
./Scripts/clear_accessibility.sh
```

### 🍎 App Store Deployment
For developers wanting to distribute BongoCat through the Mac App Store:

```bash
# Quick App Store packaging
./run.sh --app-store

# Or use the interactive menu
./run.sh
# Select option 9: "Build release, sign and package for App Store distribution"
```

**📋 Requirements**: Apple Developer Program membership, App Store distribution certificate, and App Store Connect setup. See [App Store Guide](Scripts/app_store_guide.md) for detailed instructions.

See [`Scripts/README.md`](Scripts/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **App won't start**: Right-click and select "Open" if you get a security warning
- **Cat not animating**: Check accessibility permissions in System Preferences
- **Position resets**: Use "Save Current Position" in the context menu
